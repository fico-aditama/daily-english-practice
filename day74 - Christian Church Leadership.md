"Christian Church leadership reveals three key aspects:

First, ordained leadership. The church recognizes:
- Bishops: Overseeing multiple churches
- Priests: Leading local congregations
- Deacons: Serving communities
- Pastors: Shepherding flocks
- Ministers: Preaching and teaching

Second, lay leadership. The church empowers:
- Elders: Providing wisdom
- Deacons: Managing resources
- Teachers: Educating believers
- Musicians: Leading worship
- Volunteers: Serving needs

Third, organizational structures. The church operates through:
- Hierarchical: Top-down authority
- Congregational: Local autonomy
- Presbyterian: Representative
- Episcopal: Bishop-led
- Charismatic: Spirit-led"

[Challenges]
"Despite these structures, leadership faces challenges in:
- Authority and accountability
- Training and development
- Succession planning
- Cultural adaptation
- Conflict resolution"

[Future Vision]
"Here are three key areas the church continues to develop:

1. Leadership Development - Training future leaders
2. Servant Leadership - Following Christ's example
