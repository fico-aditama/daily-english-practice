### YouTube Script: "Indonesia's Economic Rise in the Global Arena"

[Opening]
"Hello everyone! Today, let's explore Indonesia's growing economic influence on the global stage. As the world's fourth most populous country and Southeast Asia's largest economy, Indonesia is making waves in international markets."

"Indonesia's economic journey presents three fascinating aspects:

First, the digital economy boom. According to Google, Temasek, and Bain's e-Conomy SEA 2023 report, Indonesia's e-commerce market reached $77 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach $130 billion by 2025. Companies like Gojek and Tokopedia have become regional tech giants, with GoTo Group (their merged entity) achieving a market capitalization of over $10 billion.

Second, the country's strategic position in global supply chains. As reported by the US Geological Survey, Indonesia produced 1.6 million metric tons of nickel in 2023, making it the world's largest producer. The country's recent ban on nickel ore exports, as documented in Presidential Regulation No. 55/2022, has attracted over $20 billion in foreign investment for local processing facilities, particularly from Chinese EV battery manufacturers.

Third, Indonesia's demographic dividend. The World Bank's 2023 Indonesia Economic Prospects report highlights that 70% of Indonesia's 275 million population is under 40, creating a young, tech-savvy workforce. This demographic advantage has attracted over $40 billion in foreign direct investment in 2023, according to the Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM).

[Economic Challenges]
"Despite these strengths, Indonesia faces significant challenges. The World Bank's Logistics Performance Index 2023 ranks Indonesia 63rd globally in infrastructure quality. The country's ambitious goal to become a high-income nation by 2045, as outlined in the National Long-Term Development Plan (RPJPN), requires sustained reforms and investment."

[Future Outlook]
"Here are three key areas to watch in Indonesia's economic development:

1. Green energy transition - Indonesia's vast renewable energy potential, with 400 GW of solar capacity potential according to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources
2. Digital transformation - The rise of fintech, with digital banking transactions reaching $1.2 trillion in 2023 (Bank Indonesia data)
3. Manufacturing upgrade - Moving up the value chain in key industries, with the automotive sector targeting 1.5 million electric vehicles by 2030 (Ministry of Industry)"

[Closing]
"Indonesia's economic story is one of potential and progress. As the country navigates global challenges and opportunities, its success will significantly impact regional and global markets.
