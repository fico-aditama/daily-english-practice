Hi, everyone! Today, I want to talk about something big in Indonesia. On March 20, 2025, the government passed a new law about the TNI—our military. Some people like it, but many are angry. Why? Let’s find out together.

This new TNI Law changes a few things. First, soldiers can work until they’re 60, and generals until 63. Before, it was 58. Second, the TNI can do more jobs—like fighting hackers or helping in disasters. The big change? Soldiers can now work in 14 civilian places, like courts or government offices. The government says it’s to make the military stronger for today’s problems.

But not everyone is happy. A long time ago, during the New Order time, the military had a lot of power—not just fighting, but also running the country. In 1998, people fought to stop that, and the TNI focused only on defense. Now, some say this law brings back the old days. They’re scared because soldiers in civilian jobs might control too much. Plus, the President—Prabowo, who used to be a general—can decide where soldiers go. That makes people nervous.

The way this law passed is a problem too. The DPR didn’t talk about it openly. They had secret meetings—sometimes in a fancy hotel! There wasn’t much chance for people to give ideas. On March 20, they voted fast, and it became law. Right away, students and others started protesting in cities like Jakarta. They say it’s not fair and not good for democracy.

Some people defend the law. They say it’s normal—other countries let soldiers help in civilian jobs too. It could make Indonesia safer. But others, like activists, say it’s dangerous. They point to protests getting rough and a petition with thousands of names asking to stop the law. It’s a big fight about what’s best.

So, here we are on March 24, 2025. The TNI Law is real, but people are still arguing. Will it help Indonesia or hurt it? I’d love to know what you think. Tell me below—your ideas matter! Thanks for watching!
